"""PID-keyed cache for the context SessionStart injected.

Two concurrent Claude sessions would stomp on a single shared file, so the
cache is keyed by the Claude Code process PID — stable for the life of a
session, unique across concurrent sessions on the same machine. Finding that
PID from a descendant process (the hook, or `lore hook context-log` invoked
via the Bash tool) means walking process ancestry, which is why the /proc
probing lives here too.

Stays in the CLI layer: it caches what the hook emitted, and nothing in the
domain layer reads it.
